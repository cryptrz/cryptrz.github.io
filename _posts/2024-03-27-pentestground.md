Practicing pentesting on a lab can be time consuming. Depending of the vulnerable and attacker machines, you may need to download a vulnerable virtual machine, install it, fix eventual issues on **VirtualBox** or **VMware**, start services, maybe prepare the database, tools, proxies, certificates, etc... A list of these labs is available on <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-vulnerable-web-applications-directory/">owasp.org</a>. They're fun, useful, some of them are offline, others are online.


# TryHackMe

A simple alternative to use a few of them is to go to <a href="https://tryhackme.com" target="_blank">TryHackMe</a>. You can find for example <a href="" target="_blank">OWASP Juice Shop</a>, <a href="" target="_blank">OWASP Mutillidae II</a>, <a href="" target="_blank">DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)</a>. You can execute them anytime, they're free, but you need to create a **TryHackMe** account.

# PentestGround by <a href="https://pentest-tools.com" target="_blank">pentest-tools.com</a>

If for some reason you don't want to subscribe **TryHackMe**, I've just found a nice website with this kind of learning tools for pentesters, without subscription and instantaneously available. This website is <a href="https://pentest-ground.com/" target="_blank">PentestGround</a>.

You'll find a list of vulnerable machines with different technologies, web apps, a **Redis** server and APIs like **REST API** or **GraphQL** and their vulnerabilities.

# DVWA

If you click for example the <a href="https://pentest-ground.com:4280/" target="_blank">first link</a> for **Damn Vulnerable Web Application**, you're directed to PentestGround's instance which appears in a second and is ready to use.

# REST API

You can also test a **REST API** by clicking the <a href="https://pentest-ground.com:9000/" target="_blank">third link</a>. A first page provides some technical detail and URL for this API.

If you click <a>"Scan this API"</a> bottom page, a quick walkthrough explains how to use <a href="https://app.pentest-tools.com/website-vulnerability-scanning/api-scanner" target="_blank">PentestTools</a> for testing the API without virtual machines or local tools and setup an authorization header. If you don't have any account on this website, just <a href="https://app.pentest-tools.com/login" target="_blank">subscribe here</a> before testing the API.

If you have your own virtual machines or (pen)testing tools locally installed , you can just launch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDotz4iOVNQ" target="_blank">Postman and Burp Suite</a>.

You can now explore, test and hack each of them. Thanks to <a href="https://pentest-tools.com/" target="_blank">PentestTools</a> for providing these free labs.
